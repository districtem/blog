My Blog
=======

This is a simple blog I made.  Ultimately I want to include an API to Github as well under the "Projects page."  For now it's great for tinkering.

The DB manager is MongoDB and I'm using Mongoid to create the DB.  Make sure you have MongoDB set up on your machine before cloning! 

There are bugs throughout and code I've installed but not configured, hints it will be a good project to update within Github.
